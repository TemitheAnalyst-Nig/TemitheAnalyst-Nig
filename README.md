**Tackling Child and Infant
Mortality in Africa🌍**
(10Alytics Global Hackathon 2024)
📊 **Project Overview**
Child and infant mortality rates remain a critical issue in Africa, impeding progress toward several
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being. By leveraging
data-driven approaches, this hackathon aims to identify actionable insights, develop innovative
solutions, and contribute to global efforts to reduce preventable deaths in children under five years
of age.
**Objective**
The primary objective is to utilize the provided datasets to uncover patterns, correlations, and key
drivers of child and infant mortality in African countries. Participants will propose data-driven
strategies and interventions that policymakers, healthcare providers, and organizations can adopt
to improve health outcomes for children.
**📂 Key Components**
Data Sources:
The data used in this analysis includes:
The datasets provided for this hackathon include the following:
1. Health Protection Coverage: Percentage of populations covered by health
insurance.
2. Global Vaccination Coverage: Vaccination rates for various diseases among
children.
3. Births Attended by Skilled Health Staff: The percentage of births assisted by skilled
healthcare providers.
4. Maternal Deaths by Region: Estimated maternal deaths by region and year.
5. Child Mortality by Income Level: Under-five mortality rates across different
income-level countries.
6. Infant Deaths: Annual number of infant deaths by country.
7. Youth Mortality Rates: Mortality rates for individuals under 15.
8. Causes of Death in Children Under Five: Breakdown of major causes of death
among young children:
Summary of Key Insights
Vaccination and Infant Mortality in Africa

The provided data and visualizations underscore the critical role of vaccination in reducing infant mortality rates in African countries. Key insights include:

Strong Negative Correlation: There is a clear negative correlation between vaccination coverage and infant mortality rates.
Higher vaccination rates are associated with lower infant mortality rates.
Low Vaccination Coverage: Several African countries, particularly those in Central and West Africa, have low vaccination coverage for key vaccines like RotaC, MMR, and others.
Impact on Child Health: Low vaccination coverage leaves children vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, mumps, rubella, and rotavirus infections, which can lead to severe illness and death.
Addressing the Challenge: Strengthening immunization programs, improving access to vaccines, addressing vaccine hesitancy, and investing in healthcare infrastructure are essential to improving child health outcomes.
